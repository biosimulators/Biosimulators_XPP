BioSimulators-XPP documentation
=====================================

BioSimulators-XPP provides a `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org>`_-compliant command-line interface to the `XPP <http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html>`_ simulation tool. A Docker image for this package is also available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to use XPP to execute `COMBINE/OMEX archives <https://combinearchive.org/>`_ that describe one or more simulation experiments (in `SED-ML format <https://sed-ml.org>`_) of one or more kinetic models in XPP format.

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by XPP is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/xpp>`_.

A simple web application and web service for using XPP to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at `runBioSimulations <https://run.biosimulations.org>`_.
